# =================== TODO
# Verify you are currently in line for Staging to allow deploy
# Better responses to most commands so it's not just a guess and wait
# Staging migrations
# Use a new Slack bot to set status instead of me
# Use a new Github bot to set the GH check


# ================ After final
# Enhance security using Slack tokens or whichever to prevent other people posting to the public API to deploy our envs
# Testing?
