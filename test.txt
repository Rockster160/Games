  and anxiety. It works. Its very mild and is very easy to stop using. Is the fda and dea making an ass out of themselves? If they take this medicine away from the people their just going to start using opioids. I personally know their in bed with big pharma and big pharma is losing customers from kratom. Is this why they have a witch hunt on? Seems like the dea should be pulling big pharmas poisonous opoid concoctions..  look at the 1000s of people who dies from big pharmas opeoids.seems like to me if they cared about the people health and welfare the dea and fda would get their priorities in order. Thats just my opinion and perspective. Whats your opinion on the kratom issue.is the dea right or are they making an ass out of themselves
